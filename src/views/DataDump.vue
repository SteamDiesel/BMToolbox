				The easy ways to backup this data:
				<br />- Copy all of the text below, and save it into a new text document on your computer.
				<br />- Print this page to a pdf (You could print it to paper, but then you won't be able to re-import it to this system.)
				<br /> <br>
				With your data retrieved, you could keep frequent backups as a point-in-time data 
				backup. From here you can upload it to your own cloud storage or print it to paper 
				for long term air-gapped storage. <br>
				Also, if you're really adventurous, you could use the data in your own tools.
