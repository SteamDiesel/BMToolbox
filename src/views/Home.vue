				Are you looking for a fast and feature rich CRM to start your

			<p class="mb-2">
				BDFI is a client application manager, designed and developed
				exclusively to meet the needs of asset finance professionals.

			<h3 class="text-xl">Who is BDFI for?</h3>
			<p class="mb-2">
				BDFI is built specifically for asset finance professionals!
				Asset finance is different to real estate finance (mortgage
				brokers), and it requires specific tools to do the job well.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-2">
				So BDFI is a CRM built to handle personal and commercial finance
				applications for cars, equipment and unsecured loans.
			</p>

		<div class="mt-8">
			<h3 class="text-xl">Why is it free?</h3>
			<p class="mb-2">
				This project is not under active development, so there are no
				wages to pay. There are no servers, so there are no hosting
				costs to consider.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-2">

				finance broker of 8 years,

				"Since this project I have left the finance industry and moved
				on to building bespoke software full time, so I want to give
				this platform freely to finance brokers. I hope this platform
				helps new brokerages become successful businesses."

		<div class="mt-8">
			<h3 class="text-xl">How do I get started?</h3>
			<p class="mb-2">
				The system is ready to use right now, no sign up or sales call
				needed. I recommend that you first visit
				<a
					class="hover:underline text-indigo-500 font-semibold"
					href="/settings"
					>the settings page</a
				>
				and update your brokerage details. Then make a dummy application
				and test out the features.
