			<p class="mt-5">
				All data you enter into the free version of lite.bdfi.app is saved to your browsers local storage cache (on your computer, tablet or mobile),
				this comes with the benefit of extra data security and persistent offline access.
				It also means we don't have access to your client data,
				in fact, the only data we collect is your contact information.
				<br />However:
				<strong>this means you could lose the data if you clear your browser's cache!</strong>
				<br />
			</p>
			<p class="mt-5">
				It is easy to back up your data, it can be retrieved from this app as plain text (JSON) and
				you are free to store and create backups for it as you see fit.
				Other data formats may become available on request. <br>

			<p class="mt-5">
				A cloud storage option is being considered for the lite version and

				<br />Storing your data and your client's sensitive personal information securely in 
				the cloud is costly to set up and maintain.
