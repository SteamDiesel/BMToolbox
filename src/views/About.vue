			>BDFI is a handy set of tools for 'Broker & Dealer Finance & Insurance'.</p>

			<p class="mt-5">
				This is the free version, which has some useful things needed for
				running a Finance and Insurance department in a motor dealership or even a Finance Brokerage.
				<br />The pro version is in development, due for release mid 2020.

			<h1 class="text-2xl">Where is your data?</h1>
			<p class="mt-5">
				All data you enter into the free version of lite.bdfi.app is saved to your browsers local storage cache (on your computer, tablet or mobile),
				this comes with the benefit of extra data security and persistent offline access.
				It also means we don't have access to your client data,
				in fact, the only data we collect is your contact information.
				<br />However:
				<strong>this means you could lose the data if you clear your browser's cache!</strong>
				<br />
			</p>
			<p class="mt-5">
				It is easy to back up your data, it can be retrieved from this app as plain text (JSON) and
				you are free to store and create backups for it as you see fit.
				Other data formats may become available on request.
			</p>
			<p class="mt-5">
				A cloud storage option is being considered for the lite version and
				you are encouraged to express your interest by contacting us.
				<br />Storing your data and your client's sensitive personal information securely in 
				the cloud is costly to set up and maintain. So expect that feature in 
				the pro version lanuching in the 1st quarter of 2020.

					This is a project built by me, Jason Law.
					<br />I've been a Business Manager Locum in the motor trade since 2012, an
					asset finance broker since 2014 and a web developer since 2017.
					<br />In 2012 it seemed weird that Business Managers still take handwritten
					applications... and now it's 2020 and we've made very little progress.
					<br />It's not much better in the Broker world, with the range of Credit
					CRMs available for Asset Finance Brokers being limited and prohibitively expensive.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-5">
					So I learned how to code and made a CRM that I would want to use.
					<br />I'm building the features into this system that I want, let me know if you think something is missing.
